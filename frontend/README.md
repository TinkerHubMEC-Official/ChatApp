# Chat App Frontend

This is a React + Vite + Tailwind CSS frontend for a real-time chat application. It connects to a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend with authentication and real-time messaging using Socket.IO.

## Features
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Real-time chat with Socket.IO
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Backend
Make sure your backend server is running and accessible. Update API and Socket.IO endpoints in the frontend as needed.
